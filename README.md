Communication Channel: The method of delivery, such as email, a team meeting, a formal report, or a newsletter.


Frequency: How often the communication will occur (e.g., daily, weekly, as-needed, or at project milestones).


Owner: The person or role responsible for creating and delivering the message.


Feedback Mechanism: A defined way to collect responses or measure the communication's effectiveness.
